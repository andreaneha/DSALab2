Compilation
************
 To compile this code:
 run: make prog
 *note* this runs the main.c file, which doesn't really do anything. 

 To compile the testing program:
 run: make test
 *note* I used this file to test my code as I went along

  Detailed Make options:

  make  runs the cppcheck option - in theory. I'm not sure if it actually does... sorry. 
  make prog  compiles the main.c program with the library
  make test compiles the testing.c program with the library
  make doxy creates the doxygen documentation in the docs subdirectory
  make clean removes executable files
